This repository contains an application aimed at evaluating the LSM6DSV16X IMU in the context of surfing.
The end goal of the device is to be able to detect, analyze and provide numerical data related to surfing sessions.

## Hardware overview

The device is based around:
- the [XIAO nRF52840 Sense aka XIAO BLE Sense from Seeed Studio](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeed-XIAO-BLE-Sense-nRF52840-p-5253.html), a nRF52840-based development board containing a 2MB QSPI Flash, a microphone and a basic IMU.
- the LSM6DSV16X IMU from STMicroelectronics, a smart IMU with an embedded Qvar (electrostatic charge) sensor, able to perform sensor fusion and edge computing.
- the W25Q128, a 16 Mbytes external flash, to store IMU data.

Early firmware development and product evaluation was done using breakout boards. A custom PCB has been developed using [Flux.ai](https://www.flux.ai/nicolasgoualard/lsm6dsv16xeval).

### Bootloader

In order to perform OTA DFU, the bootloader needs to be updated to the latest version (0.9.2 as of writing these lines). This can easily be done by following the instructions in [this tutorial](https://koen.vervloesem.eu/blog/how-to-upgrade-the-adafruit-nrf52-bootloader/). The appropriate bootloader can be found in the releases section of [the Adafruit bootloader repo](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_nRF52_Bootloader).

## Getting started

Before getting started, make sure you have a proper nRF Connect SDK development environment.
Follow the official
[Installation guide](https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/latest/nrf/installation/install_ncs.html).

### Initialization

The first step is to initialize the workspace folder (``my-workspace``) where
the ``example-application`` and all nRF Connect SDK modules will be cloned. Run the following
command:

```shell
# initialize my-workspace for the application (main branch)
west init -m https://github.com/nicogou/xiao-ble-lsm6dsv16x.git --mr main my-workspace
# update nRF Connect SDK modules
cd my-workspace
west update
```

### Building and running

To build the application, run the following command:

```shell
cd xiao-ble-lsm6dsv16x.git
west build app
```

A sample debug configuration is also provided. To apply it, run the following
command:

```shell
west build app -- -DEXTRA_CONF_FILE="debug.conf"
```

In order to flash the board, it needs to be in bootloader mode. To do this, quickly double press the RESET button present on the Xiao BLE Sense.
Once you have built the application, run the following command to flash it:

```shell
west flash
```

### Over-the-Air DFU

> WARNING: an issue prevents the device from resetting properly after an OTA DFU if 5V is present (aka either charging or connected through USB).

In order to perform an OTA Firmware upgrade, use `west prepare-dfu` to generate the necessary .bat file in the build/zephyr folder.

Then, put the device in OTA DFU mode by sending the `dfu ota` command via the shell.

Finally, use the Bluefruit Connect smartphone app to flash a custom firmware with the following files:
- HEX: use the zephyr.hex output file
- INIT: use the zephyr.dat file  generated by `west prepare-dfu`

## Edge Impulse
There are several steps in order to use a private Impulse in your project.
- first you need to set up the project's API key in a dedicated cmake file. This file must be called secrets.cmake. It will be picked up by CMake to set the `EI_API_KEY_HEADER` variable. An example file is provided: secrets-example.cmake. Alternatively, it can be specified when building: `west build app -- -DEI_API_KEY_HEADER="x-api-key:your_api_key"`
- secondly you need to adapt the project ID in the overlay_edge_impulse.conf file. On line 7, `CONFIG_EDGE_IMPULSE_URI="https://studio.edgeimpulse.com/v1/api/XYZ/deployment/download?type=zip"`, XYZ must be adapted with your own project ID.
- thirdly, make sure the model is built in Edge Impulse Studio's deployment tab. Otherwise the model download will result in error 500.
- finally, build and flash the firmware.

Edge Impulse can also be deactivated by setting the `EI_API_KEY_HEADER` CMake variable to an empty string, either in the secrets.cmake file or when building with west: `west build app -- -DEI_API_KEY_HEADER=""`

For more information, see [the Edge Impulse integration documentation](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/ncs-latest/page/nrf/external_comp/edge_impulse.html#downloading_from_a_private_project).

## Testing

To execute Twister integration tests, run the following command:

```shell
west twister -T tests --integration
```

## Documentation

A minimal documentation setup is provided for Doxygen and Sphinx. To build the
documentation first change to the ``doc`` folder:

```shell
cd doc
```

Before continuing, check if you have Doxygen installed. It is recommended to
use the same Doxygen version used in [CI](.github/workflows/docs.yml). To
install Sphinx, make sure you have a Python installation in place and run:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

API documentation (Doxygen) can be built using the following command:

```shell
doxygen
```

The output will be stored in the ``_build_doxygen`` folder. Similarly, the
Sphinx documentation (HTML) can be built using the following command:

```shell
make html
```

The output will be stored in the ``_build_sphinx`` folder. You may check for
other output formats other than HTML by running ``make help``.
